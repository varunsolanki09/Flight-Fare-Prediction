#Flight Fare Prediction Web Application
🚀 Overview
This is a Flask-based web application designed to predict flight ticket fares based on user inputs. By leveraging a machine learning model trained on historical flight fare data, the app provides quick and accurate fare predictions. Whether you're planning a trip or just curious about flight prices, this app gives you a reliable estimate based on relevant factors such as destination, departure date, and more.

🛠️ Installation
⚙️ Prerequisites
To run this application locally, ensure you have the following:

Python (version 3.6.10 or higher)

If Python is not yet installed on your machine, you can download the latest version from python.org.
